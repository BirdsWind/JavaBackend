# Backend Using Java 

## Background
A simple backend using static JSON, deployed on Heroku. A simple demo app to demonstrate my java, backend, infrastracture and continous integration skills. 

## How Does the Service Work? 
The Backend has a service to load JSON data dynamically. 
- The dependency managed by maven, using pom file to list the dependencies, plugins etc.
- Spring Boot framework is used to simplify the service by eliminating some boilerplate code.
- The service is deployed on Heroku, the url is https://java-backend-acccbcaccfd9.herokuapp.com, the service and continuous deployment is setup by me. 

## How to Reuse the Service?
To setup is cost effecient and can be used to any other static data.
